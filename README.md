# Tutu

Use [Nx](https://nx.dev) to build apps from shared libraries to create foundatiom for [evolving Web3](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/projects/apps/monorepo-apps/) model for creating value from ideas at the optimal rate.

1. Understand: Pattern Recognition (Good from Bad and why)
2. Evolve: collective Decision Making to identify Optimal Strategy
3. Practice: ability to co-ordinate strengths to maximise value creation

[Project Documentation](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/projects/apps/monorepo-apps/)

## Approach

Innovate at the edges then pull proven patterns into the core.

- [Web3 Analysis](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/blockchain/)
- [Web3 Startup Playbook](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/blockchain/startups/playbook)
- [Web3 Dev Roadmap](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/engineering/software/developer-roadmaps)

## Plan

Use the conversion of Scaffold-Eth TypeScript to working with NX to understand the fundamental building blocks of the ethereum ecosystem better.

- [ ] Prototype in a scaffold-eth app that has the kitchen sink of features
- [ ] Use Storybook to create a visual reference of components and their functionality
- [ ] Understand/document jobs of core depenedencies

### Web3 App Fundamentals

Use a common layer of UI components and reference functions to evolve ideas for building core types of Web3 app that can also be used to onboard new developers more efficiently.

- [ ] Create a DAO with Multi-Sig to run operations
- [ ] Create a DeFi operations project to leverage capital
- [ ] Create a base marketing project to sell ideas
- [ ] Use software to create [real world](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/projects/apps/) value

### Backend

- [ ] Ethereum combine build process of chainlink and scaffold-eth
- [ ] Run subgraphs from NX commands
- [ ] [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/)
- [ ] Etc

Evolve [roadmaps](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/engineering/software/developer-roadmaps) to create more [engineers](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/engineering/).

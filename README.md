Use [monorepo](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/projects/apps/monorepo-apps/) architecture to build multiple apps from shared libraries to create a foundational [Web3 Startup Model](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/blockchain/startups/playbook) that enables the creation of value from ideas with optimal flow.

1. [Understand:](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/humans/skills/meta-learning/) [Good Pattterns](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/engineering/software/smart-contracts/patterns/) from Bad and why?
2. [Review:](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/flow/act/) with spaced repetition linked to linked thinking documentation to accelerate actionable knowledge.
3. [Practice:](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/engineering/software/developer-roadmaps) follow the path to form good habits
4. [Coach:](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/humans/skills/leadership/coach) create an ecosystem of coaches that help others levelup with [flow](/docs/flow)
5. [Evolve:](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/flow/decide/) collective wisdom through decision making processed used for making future bets

## Approach

Innovate at the edges then pull proven patterns into the core.

- [Web3 Analysis](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/blockchain/)
- [Web3 Startup Playbook](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/blockchain/startups/playbook)
- [Web3 Dev Roadmap](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/engineering/software/developer-roadmaps)

## Plan

Help to drive standardisation of naming conventions, and best practices to help conceptual and fundamental leaps forward in the world of multi-chain development.

### Web3 App Fundamentals

Create a common library to evolve ideas for building core types of Web3 app that can also be used to onboard new developers more efficiently.

- [ ] Create a DAO with Multi-Sig to run operations
- [ ] Create a DeFi operations project to leverage capital
- [ ] Create a base marketing project to sell ideas
- [ ] Use software to create [real world](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/projects/apps/) value

### Components

Use [CDD](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/engineering/software/architecture/component-driven-development) to evolve core building blocks to rapidly evolve Web3 apps.

Use the conversion of Scaffold-Eth TypeScript to working with NX to understand the fundamental building blocks of the ethereum ecosystem better.

- [ ] Create an app to replicate scaffold-eth-typescripts **kitchen sink** of features
- [ ] Understand/document jobs of core depenedencies
- [ ] Use Storybook to create a common library with visual reference of standard components and variant use cases
- [ ] Investigate archecture of headless (any CSS lib) and and bottomless (any chain) UI components

### Backend

- [ ] Ethereum combine build process of chainlink and scaffold-eth
- [ ] Run subgraphs from NX commands
- [ ] [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/)
- [ ] Etc

Evolve [roadmaps](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/engineering/software/developer-roadmaps) to create more [engineers](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/engineering/).

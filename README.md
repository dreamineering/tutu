# Stackmates

**Goal:** [Tie the room together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezQLP1dj_t8) using [Nx](https://nx.dev) to build apps that communicate through shared libraries to communicate with the best fit blockchain to solve real-world problems.

Become efficient at running experiments so you can go from idea to creating value in the shortest time possible.

Innovate at the edges then pull proven patterns into the core.

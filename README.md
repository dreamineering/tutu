# Tutu

Break things apart and then experiment with creating new things.

**Goal:** [Tie the room together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezQLP1dj_t8) using [Nx](https://nx.dev) to build apps that communicate through shared libraries to communicate with the best fit blockchain to solve real-world problems.

Become efficient at running experiments so you can go from idea to creating value in the shortest time possible.

Innovate at the edges then pull proven patterns into the core.

## Intent

Create a foundatiom for [evolving Web3 business](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/projects/apps/monorepo-apps/) ideas.

Build value from the flow of ideas at an optimal rate.

1. Educate: Pattern Recognition (Good from Bad and why)
2. Evolve: collective Decision Making to identify Optimal Strategy
3. Practice: ability to co-ordinate strengths to maximise value creation

## Learning

- [Web3 Analysis](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/blockchain/)
- [Web3 Startup Playbook](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/blockchain/startups/playbook)
- [Web3 Dev Roadmap](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/engineering/software/developer-roadmaps)

## Plan

- [ ] Make it easier to take scaffold-eth prototyping into projects
- [ ] Add Cosmos as comparison to Eth Development
- [ ] Create a DAO with Multi-Sig to run operations
- [ ] Create a DeFi operations project to leverage capital
- [ ] Create a base marketing project to sell ideas
- [ ] Use software to create [real world](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/projects/apps/) value

Evolve [roadmaps](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/engineering/software/developer-roadmaps) to create more [engineers](https://mm.dreamineering.com/docs/engineering/).
